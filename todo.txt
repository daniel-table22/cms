Here are a few thoughts I have about my role
Regardless of wether I'm reporting to you or to Katie (assuming it's the latter), I'm currently acting in a design leadership position, working alongside Katie to not only drive the design, but also what the product is and how we work
Here again, assuming I report to Katie, I'd love for you and I to develop a more formalized working relationship
One advantage of having me work from Europe is I have access to highly skilled talent at a discount. Namely a brand designer to help more on the marketing/brand design, and a contract/FTE developer to help us move a lot faster at put stuff out in the wild. 
This also helps us provide Jon's team with a better baked product and design direction when they take it on as part of the core product. Not sure yet how this would work, but I think it will really help yours, Katie's and my desire to move fast, and with the Europe connect, at lower cost.
Lastly, if we do have a PLG soft perks-only offering, I'm assuming this will have no operational overhead, and we could actually start testing it out with European partners

I also wanted to share some thoughts on comp to help calibrate expectations
My current rate, excluding 5 weeks of PTO works out at 292K base which is too high
I'd been in the 250K for the last 18 months years
Prior to that in the 230K range for the last 8 years (base, without bonuses or equity)

I know that past comp often doesn't factor into these conversations, but I think this context is helpful in helping you understand my market value and why I'm ready to sign and stop interviewing with a 200K base offer.
